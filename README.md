# Face-detection-opencv
Face detection System using open cv and integrating it with sql lite 
 To build our face recognition system, weâ€™ll first perform face detection, 
 extract face embeddings from each face using machine learning, train a face recognition model on the embeddings, 
 and then finally recognize faces in both images and video streams with OpenCV.
